# 200 - Step 2 â€“ Setting up the Nexrender repository on the shared drive

At first you will see the content of the newly mapped network drive. It may be empty:

![Map_Network_Drive_004](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/nexrender/assets/1499433/70b253e7-104e-47bf-b8e8-cc885d26726b)

If empty, create a placeholder folder (here: **movie-digital-twin**) on the mapped network drive for storing footage and Adobe After Effects project files (*.aep) into later for in this case the movie "Digital Twin".
